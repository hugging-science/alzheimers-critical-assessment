## Project Overview

The **AI-Driven Critical Assessment of Disease Mechanisms (CADM)** project pioneers the third era of Critical Assessment in science, transitioning from traditional peer review (Era 1) and community experiments like CASP/DREAM (Era 2) to **AI-driven critical assessment (Era 3)**. 

Our mission is to harness AI and community science to transform massive volumes of preclinical biology data into actionable knowledge, ultimately accelerating the discovery of new therapies.

### Initial Focus: Alzheimer's Disease & APOE4

We begin with Alzheimer's disease, specifically investigating how the **APOE4 genetic variant** increases Alzheimer's risk. This framework is designed to extend to hundreds of diseases, creating a scalable approach to biomedical research assessment.

## The Problem We're Solving

- **99% of Alzheimer's clinical trials have failed** despite vast data generation
- **Major cause**: Inadequate critical assessment of preclinical research
- **Our solution**: AI tools that evaluate, categorize, and synthesize experimental evidence at scale

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Agentic RAG Prototype
- Develop an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for biomedical literature analysis
- Focus on **six proposed lipid mechanisms** by which APOE4 may increase Alzheimer's risk
- Implement automated evidence extraction, synthesis, and critical assessment capabilities
- Validate prototype performance against expert evaluations

### Phase 2: Evaluation & Refinement
- Comprehensive testing of the agentic RAG system
- Community feedback and iterative improvements
- Performance benchmarking and validation

### Phase 3: Expansion
- Scale to all proposed APOE4 mechanisms
- Extract therapeutic implications and actionable insights
- Build comprehensive mechanism knowledge graphs

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Prototype Development
- [ ] Design agentic RAG architecture for biomedical literature
- [ ] Implement document retrieval and processing pipeline
- [ ] Develop AI agents for evidence synthesis and critical assessment
- [ ] Create evaluation framework and metrics
- [ ] Build initial prototype focusing on APOE4 lipid mechanisms

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of prototype system
- [ ] Gather community feedback from researchers and domain experts
- [ ] Iterative improvements based on evaluation results
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against existing methods

### Phase 3: Community Engagement
- [ ] Open source release and documentation
- [ ] Community contributions and collaborative development
- [ ] Integration with existing biomedical research workflows

### Phase 4: Scaling & Expansion
- [ ] Extend to broader APOE4 mechanisms
- [ ] Publication of results and methodology
- [ ] Planning for multi-disease applications

## Technical Approach

### Agentic RAG Architecture
- **Document Retrieval Agent**: Intelligent search and filtering of biomedical literature
- **Evidence Extraction Agent**: Automated extraction of relevant experimental data and findings
- **Synthesis Agent**: Critical assessment and integration of evidence across studies
- **Quality Assessment Agent**: Evaluation of study methodology and evidence strength
- **Knowledge Graph Agent**: Construction and maintenance of mechanism relationships

### Technologies & Frameworks
- **Large Language Models**: For natural language understanding and generation
- **Vector Databases**: For efficient similarity search and retrieval
- **Agent Frameworks**: Multi-agent orchestration and coordination
- **Biomedical NLP**: Specialized models for scientific text processing
- **Knowledge Graphs**: For structured representation of mechanisms and evidence

## Long-Term Vision

Our ultimate goals include:

- **Universal Literature Assessment**: AI tools that can read, understand, and critically assess all biomedical literature
- **Rapid Hypothesis Generation**: Enable accelerated experimental design and research prioritization
- **Comprehensive Disease Ontology**: Construct a complete knowledge graph of disease mechanisms and supporting evidence
- **Open Science Ecosystem**: Foster collaborative research through partnerships with HuggingFace, CASP, and other organizations

## Community & Partnerships
