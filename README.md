## Objective

The AI-Driven Critical Assessment of Disease Mechanisms (CADM) project pioneers the third era of Critical Assessment in science-moving from traditional peer review to AI-driven critical assessment. 

Goal: Use AI and community science to transform massive volumes of preclinical biology data into actionable knowledge, ultimately accelerating the discovery of new therapies.

Initial Focus: Alzheimer's disease, specifically investigating how the APOE4 genetic variant increases Alzheimer's risk through an agentic RAG system.

## The Problem

- 99% of Alzheimer's clinical trials have failed despite vast data generation
- Major cause: Inadequate critical assessment of preclinical research
- Our solution: Agentic RAG system that evaluates, categorizes, and synthesizes experimental evidence at scale

## Long-Term Vision

- Universal Literature Assessment: AI tools that can read, understand, and critically assess all biomedical literature
- Rapid Hypothesis Generation: Enable accelerated experimental design and research prioritization
- Comprehensive Disease Ontology: Construct a complete knowledge graph of disease mechanisms and supporting evidence
- Open Science Ecosystem: Foster collaborative research through partnerships with HuggingFace, CASP, and other organizations
